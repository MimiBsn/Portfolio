        <h3> Hello there.</h3>
        <p>
          I'm Alexandra BUSSON, a <em>full-stack developper</em> with a flair
          for creating web magic, based near the beautiful city of Lyon, France.
          I dive into both front-end and back-end technologies to craft seamless
          and dynamic web applications that not only look great but also perform
          like a dream.

          When I'm not coding away, you'll likely find me running through scenic
          trails, making a splash at the pool, or enjoying a thrilling horseback
          ride. Adventure fuels my creativity, and I love every moment of it !
          I'm also a fantasy book aficionado--there's nothing quite like
          escaping into epic tales of witches, mythology and far-off lands.

          As a passionate ecologist and a dedicated advocate for all living
          rights including animals and humans rights, I'm always striving to
          make a positive impact on our planet. I'm on a journey towards
          embracing a more vegetarian lifestyle, finding joy in delicious
          plant-based foods, and championing sustainable living practices. I
          firmly believe that we can harness the power of technology to create a
          greener, kinder world.
