          I am currently facing some technical issues with the back-end of my
          Apps, because of <u>Adaptable.io's closing services</u>. <br />
          I'm trying to manage my time as best as I can to resolve those issues.

          Thank you for your understanding.

        design to server-side programming. <br />
        Each projects reflects my commitment to clean code, as I'm still
        improving the versions submitted during my training.
